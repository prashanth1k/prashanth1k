### Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

I am Prashanth and I love to call myself a technologist for no particular reason. Here are my few interests listed in no particular order :).

- CRM (that's salesforce.com for the most part - nowadays)
- Web development
- Enterprise software

&nbsp;

I don't have a lot of smart things to say, but I do write a bit.

- techformist.com: Web development, Javascript, SSGs, C#
- crmcog.com: all things CRM

&nbsp;
